📊 Power BI Returns Performance Dashboard

This is an interactive Power BI dashboard I created to explore how product returns impact overall business performance.
It helps answer questions like: Which employees contribute most to returns? How do returns affect profit? Which regions see the highest return rates?


---

What’s inside the dashboard:

A breakdown of return trends including total returns, YOY changes, and average return value.

Employee-wise contribution to returns, with comparisons using bar charts and treemaps.

Regional insights to see which cities, states, or regions are most affected.

Sales and profit numbers put in context with return activity.

Time-series visuals showing how returns change over time.

How it’s built:

The dashboard connects three key datasets:

Orders – sales, profit, categories, customers, and order details.

Returns – order IDs and return flags.

People – employees and their assigned regions.


By linking these tables together, the dashboard makes it easy to filter, drill down, and uncover insights interactively.
